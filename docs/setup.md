# Shipit setup guide

## Forewords

At this point Shipit is mostly a Rails engine, so setting it up in production requires some Rails development knowledge.

Deploying and hosting a Rails application is not trivial, and this document assumes you know how to do it.

In the future we'd like to provide it fully packaged inside a Docker container, but it hasn't been done yet.

## Creating the Rails app

*Shipit requires a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite3), Redis, and Ruby 2.6 or superior.*

Shipit provides you with a Rails template. To bootstrap your Shipit installation:

1. If you don't have Rails installed, run this command: `gem install rails -v 7.1`
2. Run this command:  `rails _7.1_ new shipit --skip-action-cable --skip-turbolinks --skip-action-mailer --skip-active-storage --skip-webpack-install --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-text -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shopify/shipit-engine/main/template.rb`

## Creating the GitHub App

Shipit needs a GitHub App to authenticate users, receive Webhooks and access the API.

You can create a new one for your organization at `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/apps/new`, or [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) for a regular user.

  - Homepage URL: The URL where Shipit will be deployed, e.g. `https://example.com`.
  - User authorization callback URL: It must be set to `<homepage>/github/auth/github/callback`, e.g. `https://example.com/github/auth/github/callback`.
  - Setup URL: Leave it empty.
  - Webhook URL: It must be set to `<homepage>/webhooks`, e.g. `https://example.com/webhooks`.
  - Webhook secret (optional): Fill it with some randomly generated string, and *keep it in clear on the side, you'll need it later*.
  - Repository permissions:
    - Checks: Read & write
    - Commit statuses: Read-only
    - Contents: Read & write (to allow merging)
    - Deployments: Read & write
    - Issues: Read & write (to allow closing related issues on merge)
    - Metadata: Read-only
    - Pull requests: Read & write

  - Organization permissions:
    - Members: Read-only
    
  - Events:
    - Check run
    - Check suite
    - Membership
    - Pull request
    - Push
    - Status


## Installing the GitHub App on your organization

Once it's created, make sure it's installed on your organization via the `Install App` menu on the side.

## Updating the config/secrets.yml

The `config/secrets.yml` file will hold your secrets, by default it is ignored by git, so it's up to you to decide how secrets are deployed in production, as Rails doesn't enforce any method.

It should look like this:

```yaml
production:
  secret_key_base: some-long-string
  host: example.com
  redis_url: "redis://redis-host"
  github:
    app_id: 42
    installation_id: 43
    bot_login: "my-app[bot]"
    webhook_secret: some-secret-value
    private_key: |

```

**`secret_key_base`** Should be generated automatically by Rails. It is used for signing session cookies etc.

**`host`** Should specify the domain of your shipit instance, e.g. `shipit.example.com`.

**`redis_url`** Should point to a working Redis database.

**`github.app_id`** The GitHub App ID, it can be found under General > About

**`github.installation_id`** The ID of your GitHub App installation, it can be found under Organization Settings > Installed GitHub Apps > Configure. Then look at the URL it should follow this pattern: `https://github.com/organizations/<you-org>/settings/installations/<app-id>`.

**`github.bot_login`** The login of the App [bot] user. Every GitHub App have an associated `[bot]` user which acts as the author of the App actions through the API, for example when an App merges a Pull Request. It should be the App "slug" with the suffix `[bot]`. For example if your app settings URL is `https://github.com/organizations/ACME/settings/apps/acme-shipit/installations`, the bot user should be `acme-shipit[bot]`. If you are unsure, you can leave it empty.

**`github.webhook_secret`** If you've set a webhook secret during the App creating, you should copy it here.

**`github.private_key`** In your GitHub App settings, on the `General` section, you can generate and download a private key. You will end up with a `.pem` file and you need to copy it's content here.

**`github.oauth.id`** and **`github.oauth.secret`** In your GitHub App settings, on the `General` section, you can find these two at the bottom of the page.

**`github.oauth.teams`** optional, required only if you want to restrict access to a set of GitHub teams.

If it's missing, the Shipit installation will be public unless you setup another authentication method.

After you change the list of teams, you have to invoke `bin/rake teams:fetch` to prefetch the team members.

For example:

```yml
production:
  github:
    oauth:
      id: (your application's Client ID)
      secret: (your application's Client Secret)
      teams:
        - Shipit/team
        - Shipit/another_team
```

**`commands_inactivity_timeout`** is the duration after which Shipit will terminate a command if no ouput was received. Default is `300` (5 minutes).

For example:
```yml
production:
  commands_inactivity_timeout: 900 # 15 minutes
```

**`default_merge_method`** is the merge method used by the merge queue unless specified otherwise in the stack's `shipit.yml`. Can be either `merge`, `rebase`, or `squash`. If not set it will default to `merge`.

For example:
```yml
production:
  default_merge_method: squash
```

**`update_latest_deployed_ref`** can be set to true to have a shipit maintain a git branch pointing to the last deployed commit.

```yml
production:
  update_latest_deployed_ref: true
```

### Using Multiple Github Applications

A Github application can only authenticate to the Github organization it's installed in. If you want to deploy code from multiple Github organizations the `github` section of your `config/secrets.yml` will need to be formatted differently. The top-level keys should be the name of each Github organization, and the following sub-keys are the Github app details for that particular organization.

For example:

```yml
production:
  github:
    somegithuborg:
      app_id:
      installation_id:
      webhook_secret:
      private_key:
      oauth:
        id:
        secret:
        teams:
    someothergithuborg:
      app_id:
      installation_id:
      webhook_secret:
      private_key:
      oauth:
        id:
        secret:
        teams:
```

## Running Cron

Shipit requires some periodic tasks to be executed to function properly. If you're running on Heroku, you can use the [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) add on to run Shipit cron jobs, though it will only run at a maximum frequency of once every 10 minutes.

 - Run `bin/rake cron:minutely` as close to every minute as possible
 - Run `bin/rake cron:hourly` as close to every hour as possible
